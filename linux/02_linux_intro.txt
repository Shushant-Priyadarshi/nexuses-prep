🎯 What is Linux:
    1) Linux is an open source operating system.
    2) Created by Linux torvalds in 1991.
    3) No Antivirus needed, gr8 security, open source

🎯 What is Unix?
    Unix is a family of operating systems that originated in the late 1960s at AT&T's Bell Labs. It was designed to be a multiuser, multitasking operating system with a simple and modular architecture, making it highly portable and reliable. Unix is not just an operating system but also a set of design philosophies that prioritize:

   1) Simplicity: Each program should do one thing well.
   2) Modularity: Small tools that can be combined to perform complex tasks.
   3) Portability: It can run on different hardware platforms.
   4) Text-based Configuration: System interactions are file-based, 
         often manipulated using text editors.

🎯 BootLoader:
    1) A small program that loads the operating system.
    2) Starts the Linux kernel during the boot process.
    3)Functions:
        a) Initializes hardware (keyboard, screen, etc.).
        b) Loads the Linux kernel into memory.
        c) May allow the user to choose between multiple operating systems.
        ⭐️Examples: GRUB (GNU GRUB), LILO.

🎯 Kernel:
    1) The core of the Linux operating system.
    2) Acts as a bridge between hardware and software.
    3)Functions:
        a) Manages hardware resources (CPU, memory, devices).
        b) Allocates resources to programs.
        c) Ensures system stability and multitasking.
        ⭐️Example: The Linux Kernel 
    
   🎯 The Linux Kernel :
        The Linux kernel is the core component of the Linux operating system.

        🎯 How the Linux Kernel Works?
            1) Interaction with Hardware:The kernel communicates directly with the hardware using device drivers.For example, when you type something, the kernel receives input from the keyboard and sends it to the application.

            2) Resource Management:The kernel allocates system resources (CPU time, memory, etc.) to processes (programs running on your computer).It ensures no two processes interfere with each other.

            3) Process Management:Every running program (process) is managed by the kernel.It decides which process runs, for how long, and in what order (using a scheduler).

            4)The kernel organizes how data is stored and retrieved on disks using file systems. For example, it translates a file path (like /home/user/file.txt) into physical disk locations.

            5) Security and Isolation: The kernel enforces user permissions, ensuring that one user’s actions don’t affect others. It also isolates processes for security and stability.


🎯 Shell:
    1) A command-line interface (CLI) or program that interacts with the kernel.
    2) Acts as a middleman between the user and the kernel.
    3) Accepts user commands and translates them into instructions for the kernel.
    4) Executes programs, scripts, and commands.
    5) Types:
       a) CLI Shells: Bash, Zsh, Fish.
       b) Graphical Shells: GNOME Shell.
